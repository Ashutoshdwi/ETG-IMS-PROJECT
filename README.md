# ETG-IMS-PROJECT
This is a inventory management project for products and their atrributes.
I have created 2 seperate JSON files for the project to be clean for the viewer to read.
The two JSON files are Record.json and Sales.json .
I also added a seperate program using function to update the added quantity in Items list.
For making things a little bit interesting, I also added a program that helps us to calculate one day profit of the resepective organization.
